INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:-
1. Upon simply running the exe file ,the executable will ask to enter the details of borrower.
2. It will do the calculations and inform you accordingly.

My model works upon the principle of OOPS implementing some basic functions and concepts.My model has these classes primarily:
1. Bank class inheriting data from interest class(used for implementing interest rates) and stores the net money in bank along with interest rates egligible.
2. Borrower class inheriting data from borrower_details(used for implementing borrower details)
3. A friend function which can access data and methods of these 2 classes and is used to finally lend the loan.

Finally calling the function creates an object of borrower class and bank class and input details to do the calculations. Finally after the calculations are done, it returns 2 possiblitites:-
1.That guy can get the desired loan at an interest rate calculated using his/her previous records.
2.The loan is rejected.
It considers previous records of that person along with the amount of money asked and eveluates the result.One just needs to enter the details asked and it will evaluate accordingly.

It completely depends upon the model wheter th model is centralizd or not.

In my mode, only 1 bank provides loan and every individual/corporation have to approach that particular bank in order to avail a loan.It maintains a common database and uses same functions to everyone's properties and give loan to them(if they are eglibile). Since only one authority looks over all the banks, it is centralized.

Although a centralized system looks easy to manage and more secure it has some demerits:
1. Failure of the bank will stop all the processes which isn't the case in decentralized systems.
2. In most of the cases, decentralized systems can cover every segment and range of customers while centralized is better for systems targetting lesser variety of customers.
3. Decentralized systems are very easy to upgrade and change while changing a centralized system isn't easy.
4. Due to its large size Centralized systems are more prone to errors and delays.
5. A centralized system is relatively large and powerful thus bringing less transperancy.

There are some merits too:
1. It is relatively easy to setup and allot resources to.
2. Economies of scale make centralized systems to operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
3. In most of the cases, it provides more facilities and features then decentralised systems.

With proper research, decentralised system is replacing centralised systems like blockchain.
